# StudBud - Web Prototype
Made by Ben Caruso (bcar9303)

In this README file, I go over the design iteration process for StudBud which depicts the transition from the mockup (made in XD) to the final prototype. I also use this file tor reflect on the entire project and what skills and resources I have taken away from it.

## Project Development Documentation

### User Testing

The StudBud web prototype was presented to a number of friends and family in order to gauge the webpage's user friendliness and  aesthetic appeareance. This feedback was then used to adjust and include suggested features which have been outlined in the development documentation. I've learnt that user testing is a critical part of any web design project, because at the end of the day, it is important to know your audience and include their needs within your design.

### Reflection

Upon completing StudBud, I have greatly deepened my understanding of HTML, CSS, Javascript and Git. I think these tools are immensely important in the world of web design and it's important I continue to sharpen them. I think I will need to go over some things in Javascript as there is greater depth and understanding that I'm still not familiar with. I find the process of completing webpages like StudBud quite interesting and I wonder if it a possible career path either as a front end or back end web developer.

### References

Websites, YouTube tutorials and tutor tutorials were greatly utilised in order to complete this project. I also looked at a lot of Stack Overflow forum posts and W3Schools, so instead of referencing individual posts and pages I have just referenced Stack Overflow and W3Schools. Images for the musicplayer are also referenced.
